#### Course Description

This course will provide both an introduction to programming for the web, and guide students through the process of building creative web-based projects. JavaScript is the de facto programming language of the web, so a lot of our time will be spent learning how to actually write code. At first we're just going to be learning the basics: how to use developer tools, how to read documentation, how to properly indent code, and strategies for debugging. As working with JavaScript becomes more familiar as the semester progresses, assignments will provide more opportunities for more creative projects.

I'm assuming that students are coming into the class already familiar with writing HTML and CSS, but haven't written code in a procedural language like JavaScript.

#### Objectives

* Students should be able to describe the functionality of web-oriented programming languages and their appropriate use.
* Students should become familiar with at least one web-based scripting language and use it to develop complex web pages.
* Students should successfully employ and debug projects using the programming languages taught in class.

#### Academic Integrity

The University has a published policy on academic integrity that may be found at [http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/current/integrity.cfm](http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/current/integrity.cfm).

#### Please be on time

Two unexcused absences will lead to a grade reduction. If you are late three times, it is equivalent to one absence.

#### Grading

Each week you'll be given an assignment to work on, due at the following class meeting. These assignments comprise the largest portion of your grade, and will be graded along three axes:

* Completeness: does your implementation actually do the thing it's supposed to?
* Clarity of code: is the code itself written consistently, using good conventions?
* Aesthetics: are you making something people will actually want to use?

Grades are given based on:â€¨

* Assignments: 30%
* Midterm: 25%
* Final: 25%
* Professionalism: 20% (participation in class, meeting deadlines, and attendance)
